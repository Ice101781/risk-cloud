&nbsp; This web application is completely client-side, with a single dependency on <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">Three.js</a>. The current build allows users to visualize structures with a maximum of four legs and sixth months to expiry using the Black-Scholes-Merton model. Click the corresponding link in the MODEL sub-menu to begin a new trade.

&nbsp; <i>Note that in the images below, the site is being accessed locally. In addition to a live version, users can opt to <a href="https://github.com/Ice101781/risk_cloud/archive/master.zip">download</a> a `.zip` file of the entire app which can then be used without an internet connection.</i>
